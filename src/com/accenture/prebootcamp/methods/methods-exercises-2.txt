12. Implement a method "search" which has two parameters (array of whole numbers called "numbers" and a whole number called "number")
    and checks if array "numbers" contains "number" and if it does, then it returns the index of the number;
    Here is example of how to use the method:
        // in ararys we start counting indexes from 0.
        // So number 3 has index 0, number 12 has index 1 and so forth
        int[] numbers = {3, 12, 2};
        int result = search(numbers, 12);
        System.out.println(result); //this should print 1 (because number 12 has index 1)


13. Implement a method: (name it "toThePowerOf") which has two parameters (int base and int power) and returns the
   result (base to power). Write a program which asks user to input two whole numbers from and calls
   the method with those numbers and then prints the result of the method.
   For example: if user inputs 2 and 3, the result should be 8 (because 2^3=8).
   You can't use Math.pow() method!

   hint: to implement "To the power of" you can use loop and multiplication. For example,
         2 to the power 3 can be calculated as follows:
         2 * 2 = 4; (first iteration)
         4 * 2 = 8; (second iteration)
         Basically, we will need a variable "sum" where we store the result and then keep multiplying
         it with value power the same amount of times as the value of power.


14. Implement a method "calculateAverage" which has one parameter (array of whole numbers) calculates
    and returns the average of all number in array. Write an example program which uses this
    method and prints out the result.
    Example of method usage:
        int [] numbers = {1, 2, 3};
        int result = calculateAverage(numbers);
        System.out.println(result); //prints out 2
    hint: To calculate the average value of all the numbers in array you will need to sum all
          numbers in array and divide it by the length of array.


15. Implement a method (generateArray) which accepts whole number (int arrayLength) and creates/returns new array which
    is the size of "arrayLength" populate it with random, positive whole numbers. Write an example
    program which uses this method and prints out the result.
    hint: use new Random().nextInt() to generate random number, search google for more info.

    For example, the return value of generateArray(3) could be array which has values 2, 20, 1
    inside.
