5. Write a Java program to calculate the revenue from a sale based on the unit price and quantity of a product input by
 the user. The discount rate is 10% if the quantity purchased is between 100 and 120 units, and 15% for the quantity
 greater than 120 units. If the quantity purchased is less than 100 units, the discount rate is 0%. See the 3
 examples below:
   Example 1:
     Input:
        Enter unit price: 25
        Enter quantity: 110
     Output:
        The revenue from sale: 2475.0 EUR
        Discount: 275.0 EUR (10.0%)

   Example 2:
     Input:
         Enter unit price: 25
         Enter quantity: 100
      Output:
         The revenue from sale: 2500.0 EUR
         Discount: 0.0 EUR (0.0%)

   Example 3:
