//    Create a class "Car" which is a subclass of "Vehicle":
//        Add a private property "fuel" (whole number) and public getter method for it
//        Add a private property "horsePower" and a public getter method
//        Add a constructor with parameters brand, speed and horsePower:
//            In this constructor first call the parent constructor and pass brand and speed as arguments to it.
//            Then initialize horsePower. And then initialize fuel to 50 (this will be default).
//        Override method "move" so it outputs text: "driving at [speed]km/h"
//        Override method "description" so it outputs text:
//                "This is a [brand] car which can drive at [speed] km/h. It has [fuel]l of fuel left in tank."
//        Add public method "addFuel" with parameter (whole number) which increments "fuel" value
//        Add public method "checkFuel" which outputs "[fuel] left in tank"
//        Add public method "power" outputs: "this car has [horsePower] horse power"
