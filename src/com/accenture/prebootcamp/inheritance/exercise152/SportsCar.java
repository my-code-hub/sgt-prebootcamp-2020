//  Create a class "SportsCar" which is a subclass of "Car":
//        Add a private property "turbo" (whole number)
//        Override method "move" so it outputs text:
//            "racing sports car at [speed] km/h"

//            In this constructor first call the parent constructor and pass brand and speed as arguments to it.
//        Override method "power" which outputs "this car has a [horsePower + turbo] horse power"
