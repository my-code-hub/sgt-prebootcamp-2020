1) Write a program which creates two dimensional array and stores multiplication table (from 1 - 10) in it.
    Example of output:
        1 * 1 = 1
        1 * 2 = 2
        1 * 3 = 3
        ....
        10 * 9 = 90
        10 * 10 = 100

    Hint: don't forget that you have to save the values in array and output them from array.
