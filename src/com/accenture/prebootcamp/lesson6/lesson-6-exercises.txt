************************* user input *****************************
1) Write Java program to allow the user to input two integer values and then the program prints the results of adding,
    subtracting, multiplying, and dividing among the two values.

       Enter value a: 30
       Enter value b: 10

       The result 30 + 10 is 40.
       The result 30 - 10 is 20;
       The result of 30 * 10 is 300.
       The result of 30 / 10 is 3.


2) Write a Java program that reads a number in inches, converts it to meters.
   Note: One inch is 0.0254 meter.
       Test Data
            Input a value for inch: 1000
       Expected Output :
            1000.0 inch is 25.4 meters


3) Ask user to input three words and put them in this sentence:
    Example:
       Please input your name: John
       Please input your job title: Programmer
       Please input your age: 60

    Expected output:
    "Hello, my name is John and I'm Programmer. I'm 60 years old."


*********************** relational operators ******************************************************
4) Ask user to input two numbers, compare them and output result:
   Input:
       Enter value a: 10
       Enter value b: 10
   Expected output:
       is 10 equal to 10? - true
       is 10 less than 10? - false
       is 10 less or equal to 10? - true
       is 10 greater than 10? - false
       is 10 greater or equal to 10? - true


5) Ask user to input two boolean values and compare them.
    Input:
       Enter b1: true
       Enter b2: false

    Expected output:
       Is b1 and b2 equal? - false


6) Ask user to input a whole number and output true, if it is even number and false if it is odd number
    Hint: use reminder operator to divide number by two and get reminder (if reminder is 0 then it means it is even
    number)


7) Ask user to input a whole number and output false, if it is even number and true if it is odd number
