1. declare and initialize array with six arbitrary whole numbers. Write a code which:
    1) prints out all of the numbers from array
    2) prints out all of the numbers from array in reverse order


2. Define an array with six arbitrary whole numbers. Write a program that finds second highest number in array and
   the lowest number in array. Output those numbers.


3. Write a program which asks user to input the size of array. Declare and initialize array of
   whole numbers with such size. Then ask user to input numbers and fill the array.
   Then calculate and output the average value of elements in this array.


4. Declare and initialize array with six arbitrary whole numbers. Write a Java program  which asks input from user (a
  whole number) and tests if an array contains this value. The program finishes only after user has entered a
  number which exists in array two times.


5. Declare and initialize array with four arbitrary whole numbers. Write a Java program to copy this array by iterating
 it.


6. Ask user to input positive arbitrary whole number and print Fibonacci sequence till that number. Also create new
   array and save all of the fibonacci numbers in this array. For example, if user inputs number 10 the output should
   be:
       0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 + 34
