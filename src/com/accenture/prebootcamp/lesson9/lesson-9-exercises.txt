1. declare and initialize array with six arbitrary whole numbers. Write a code which:
    1) prints out all of the numbers from array
    2) prints out all of the numbers from array in reverse order


2. Define an array with seven whole numbers (30, 15, 15, 3, 15, 12, 13). Write a program that finds second highest
 number in array and the lowest number in array. Output those numbers.


3. Write a program which asks user to input the size of array. Declare and initialize array of
   whole numbers with such size. Then ask user to input numbers and fill the array.
   Then use this array to calculate and output the average value of elements in this array.
   Hint: for learning purposes, use two loops in this exercise (even though it could be implemented with single loop).
    1) In first loop just ask the numbers from user and fill the array
    2) In second loop calculate the average of elements in array.

   Example:
        Please enter count of numbers: 4
        1. please enter number: 2
        2. please enter number: 4
        3. please enter number: 4
        4. please enter number: 6
   Output:
        Average of 2 4 4 6 is 4


4. Declare and initialize array with six arbitrary whole numbers. Write a Java program  which asks input from user (a
  whole number) and tests if an array contains this value. The program finishes only after user has entered a
  number which exists in array two times.


5. Declare and initialize array with four arbitrary whole numbers. Write a Java program to copy this array by iterating
 it.


6. Ask user to input positive arbitrary whole number x and print then print x Fibonacci sequence numbers. Also
create new array and save all of the fibonacci numbers in this array. Then output the array. For example, if user inputs
 number 10 the output should be:
       0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
