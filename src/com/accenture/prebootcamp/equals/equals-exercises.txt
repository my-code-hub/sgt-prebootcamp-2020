1. equals/hashcode:
    - create class "Person" with properties "name", "age" and "personalId"
    - create constructor with parameters "name", "age" and "personalId"
    - create getter methods for all of these properties
    - override equals method and change it so instances of type Person would only be equal to
      each other if personalId is equal.
    - write a program which creates a few instances of Person and checks equality between them.
      (example where two persons are equal and not equal)
    - also override hashCode method
