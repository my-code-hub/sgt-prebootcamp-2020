1. create class "Animal" with properties "type", "name" and "age"
    * create constructor with parameters "name" and "age" for setting the properties
    * create two objects each with different names and ages (two objects of type "cat" and one "dog")
    * create a method "makeSound" which prints "wuff!" if the animal type is "dog" or "meow!" if
      the animal type is "cat"

    Hint: Create class ObjectsExercise1 with main method. Here you can create instances of class Animal,
          call methods, etc.



2. create a class "BankAccount" with property "balance" (should be decimal number)
    * create empty default constructor for it
    * create a constructor with parameter for setting balance.
    * create a method "deposit" with one parameter "amount" (decimal number) which allows user to increase his balance.
    * create a method "withdraw" with one parameter "amount" (decimal number) which allows user to decrease his balance.
    * create a method "printBalance" which displays the current balance to user
    * method for transfer balance from one bank account to another
