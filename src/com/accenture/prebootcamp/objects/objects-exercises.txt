1. create class "Animal" with properties "type", "name" and "age"
    * create constructor with parameters "name" and "age" for setting the properties
    * create two objects each with different names and ages (two objects of type "cat" and one "dog")
    * create a method "makeSound" which prints "wuff!" if the animal type is "dog" or "meow!" if
      the animal type is "cat"

    Hint: Create class ObjectsExercise1 with main method. Here you can create instances of class Animal,
          call methods, etc.
