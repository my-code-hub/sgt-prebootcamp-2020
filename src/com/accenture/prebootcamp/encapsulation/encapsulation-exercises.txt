E.1. See sources files in package com.accenture.prebootcamp.encapsulation.excersises.exercise1.
  Start this exercise by following steps in class "A", then class "B" and then "BaseApp" and "InnerApp"


E.2. Create class "MyList". Add property "list" which is of type array with text elements.
   1. Create default constructor which initializes "list" to a new empty array of size 3.
   2. Create another constructor which has one parameter "size" (whole number) and
      use this variable to create new empty array of that size and assign it to "list"
   3. Make sure property "list" is not accessible directly from other class (it has to be encapsulated).
   4. Create method "add" for adding element to the list. (this method should be accessible publicly)
   5. Create method "printList" which outputs the list. (only accessible on package level)
   6. Create class "ListProgram" which:
        1. Creates a new instance of "MyList" with default constructor
        2. Add two elements to your list (any values)
        3. Output all of the values in your list
        4. Create another list. This time specify size 5.
        5. Add 4 elements to this list
        6. Output all of the values in your list
