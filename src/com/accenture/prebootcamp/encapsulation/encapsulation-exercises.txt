E.1. See sources files in package com.accenture.prebootcamp.encapsulation.excersises.exercise1.
  Start this exercise by following steps in class "A", then class "B" and then "BaseApp" and "InnerApp"


E.2. Create class "MyList". Add property "list" which is of type array with text elements.
   1. Create default constructor which initializes "list" to a new empty array of size 3.
   2. Create another constructor which has one parameter "size" (whole number) and
      use this variable to create new empty array of that size and assign it to "list"
   3. Make sure property "list" is not accessible directly from other class (it has to be encapsulated).
   4. Create method "add" for adding element to the list. (this method should be accessible publicly)
   5. Create method "printList" which outputs the list. (only accessible on package level)
   6. Create class "ListProgram" which:
        1. Creates a new instance of "MyList" with default constructor
        2. Add two elements to your list (any values)
        3. Output all of the values in your list
        4. Create another list. This time specify size 5.
        5. Add 4 elements to this list
        6. Output all of the values in your list


E.3. Add more functionality to your previous program. For example, make it possible for user to:
     1. Add item to the list
     2. view the list
     3. Remove item from list
     4. Edit any item in the list
          edit 3 buy milk and eggs

     You can implement the following commands:
        (note: for all examples below, let's assume we already have two items in our list:
                1 Buy milk
                2 Go to the gym)

        1) printList - command has no arguments, it just prints the list to the user.
            Example input:
                printList

            Example output:
                1 Buy milk
                2 Go to the gym

        2) add [TEXT] - command adds new item at the end of the list and prints the list.
            Example input:
                add Mow the lawn
            Example output:
                1 Buy milk
                2 Go to the gym
                3 Mow the lawn

        3) remove [INDEX] - removes element from list and prints the list.
            Example input:
                remove 2
            Example output:
                1 Buy milk

        4) edit [INDEX] [TEXT] - modifies element in the list and prints the list.
            Example input:
                edit 1 Buy milk and eggs!
            Example output:
                1 Buy milk and eggs!
                2 Go to the gym
