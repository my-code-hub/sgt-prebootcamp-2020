1. Ask user to input two strings. Then compare if those two strings are the same and output the result. Comparing
   strings should be case sensitive ("Hello" and "hello" should not be equal)
    Example:
        Input text 1: Hello, world!
        Input text 2: Hello, John!
    Output:
        "Hello, world!" is not equal to "Hello, John!"


2. Ask user to input two strings. Then compare if those two strings are the same (ignore case sensitivity) and output
  the result. Comparing strings should NOT be case sensitive ("Hello" and "hello" is considered to be equal)
    Example:
        Input text 1: Hello
        Input text 2: hello
    Output:
        "Hello" is equal to "hello"


3. Write a java program to get the length of a given string.
    Example:
        Input string: example.com
    Output:
        The string length of 'example.com' is: 11


4. Ask user to input string. Write a Java program to replace all the 'd' characters with 'f' characters.
    Example:
        Please input text: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
    Output:
        The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy fog.


5.  Ask user to input any string. Write a Java program to check whether a given string starts with "Hello"
   or ends with "bye!".
     Example:
        Please input text: Hello, everyone!
     Output:
        Starts with "Hello"? true
        Ends with "bye!"? false


6. Ask user to input string and two numbers ("start" and "end"). Output the part of the text from this string:
    which starts at number "start" and ends at number "end" (both inclusive).
    Example:
        Input text: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
        Input start: 5
        Input end: 13
    Output:
        "quick bro"

    !Hint: make sure that program works if we enter negative start/end number or too high start/end number.


7. Ask user to input any string and output the same string in uppercase.
    Example:
        Input text: hello, world!
    Output:
        HELLO, WORLD!


8. Write a Java program to trim any leading or trailing whitespace from a given string.
    Example:
        Input text:     hello, world!
    Output:
        "hello, world!"


9. Write a program which asks the user to input sentence. Split the sentence into words and output all words
    in random order.
    Example:
        Input text: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
    Output:
        jumps quick lazy over The brown dog jumps fox the


10. Ask user to input string. Write a Java program to reverse every word in a string using methods.
    Example input:
        This is a test string
    Output:
        sihT si a tset gnirts


11. Write a java program which asks user to input sentence and counts how many each letter appears in sentence
  and outputs the result. (uppercase and lowercase should be considered as the same symbol)
    Example input:  hello! How are you?
    Example output:
        h - 2
        e - 2
        l - 2
        o - 3
        w - 1
        a - 1
        r - 1
        y - 1
        u - 1

    Note: Program has to support only english letters. You can ignore spaces, exclamation marks, etc.
