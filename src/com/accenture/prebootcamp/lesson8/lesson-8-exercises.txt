1) Write a program that asks user to input number and prints out the name of the corresponding day.
   If user inputs any other number than 1 - 7, then print out "There is no such day, please enter numbers 1 - 7!"
   You have to use switch / case statements. You can't use if / else.
    example 1:
        Input: 1
        Output: Monday
    example 2:
        Input: 7
        Output: Sunday


2) Write a program to print numbers from 10 to -10. Implement three variations of this exercise: with for loop, while
 loop and do while loop.


3) Write a program to print every second number from 1 to 20
    (implement it with for and also with while loop)
    Example:
        1, 3, 5 ... and so on
    And make sure there is no comma after the last number. :)


4) Ask user to input two whole numbers. Write a program which prints all even numbers between the numbers which user did
input. If first number is greater than second, then print message "First number has to be less than second."
and ask the user to enter the numbers again.


6) Two numbers are entered through the keyboard. Write a program to find the value of one number raised
to the power of another. (Do not use available Java built-in method)


7) Modify Exercise1 from lesson 7 so the program doesn't terminate after first time user entered a number, but keeps
   asking user number and outputting result 3 times.
   (use do-while loop)


8) Write a program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess what the number is. If the user's guess
    is higher than the random number, the program should display "Too high, try again." If the user's guess is lower
    than the random number, the program should display "Too low, try again." The program should use a loop that
    repeats until the user correctly guesses the random number.

    Hint: to find out how to generate a random number, please google "Java generate random number"
