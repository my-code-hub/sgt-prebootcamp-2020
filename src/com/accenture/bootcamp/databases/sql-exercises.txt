**** Setup and connect to DB ****
    1) Install MySql on your computer:
        MySql installer link: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/
        (instructions might differ per operation system, google to find out more).
    2) Install database client: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/


*** Exercise 40 - creating schema & tables ***
    Write the following SQL queries:
        1. Create database and name it: "pet_clinic".
        2. Create table "pets" with the following columns (choose appropriate data type):
            id, name, type
        3. Modify table and add column "date_of_birth", "age" and "color"
        4. Now modify table and remove the "color" column
        5. Create table "vets" with single column (id)
        6. Delete table "vets"

    !!! IMPORTANT !!!: Each SQL statement for each of the points in this exercise
        has to be sent to teacher in slack.


*** Exercise 41 - manipulating data ***
    Write SQL queries necessary to complete the points below:
        1. insert three pets in the "pets" table with the following values:
            id - 1, name - Reksis, type - Husky, age - 5
            id - 2, name - Buddy, type - Afador, age - 3
            id - 3, name - Bailey, type - Akita, age 7
            id - 4, name - Lucy, type - Auggie, age 11
            id - 5, name - Oscar, type - Afador, age 8
        2. Write query which updates age for a dog with name "Reksis" to 7
        3. Write query which updates age to 7 for a any dog with name "Buddy" and type "Afador"
        4. Write query which deletes all dogs with age greater than 10
        5. Set date_of_birth for all dogs to be 1st January, year 2015
        6. Alter column date_of_birth in table pets so it would not allow null
          values and the default value of this column (if not specified when inserting entry) would be
          current date. (see https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/data-type-defaults.html )
        7.  Select the oldest pet in table
        8.  Select youngest pet in table
        9.  Select average age of pets in pets table
        10. Count how many pets are there in table


*** Exercise 42 - Primary and foreign key exercise ***
    1. Modify id column of the pets table so it would be PRIMARY KEY, NOT NULL and AUTO INCREMENT
    2. Try to insert a new pet without specifying id. What happened? Did
        database automatically generate a id for you?
    3. Now try to insert two different pet entries into database with the same id.
        What happened when you tried doing that? What did MySQL console say?
    4. Create new table "owners" with the following columns:
        id - integer, PRIMARY KEY, NOT NULL and AUTO INCREMENT
        first_name, last_name, address, city, telephone
    5. Add three entries into owners table.
        John, Jane and Max (last name, address, city and phone is up to you)
    6. Now you have to create relation between owners and pets table.
        a. Add owner_id column to pets table (data type should match the id column of owners table)
        b. Update pets table so pets would have owners:
            Reksis -> John
            Buddy  -> Max
            Bailey -> Max
            Oscar  -> Jane
        c. Now delete Jane from owners table.
            Did this work?
            Should this work and is the data in pets table correct/valid now?
            What is the value of owner_id colum n for Oscar? Do you see a problem here?
    7. Add foreign key constraint to owner_id column of pets table.
         To which foreign key should this column point?
         You will most likely fail initially when you try to do it. Read the error
         and try to understand why. You might have to change data in one of the tables.
    8. After you successfully created foreign key, inset Jane back into owners table.
    9. Now try to delete owner with name 'Max'
        Did it work? Why?
        Should it work?
    10. Add new pet with owner_id 1001. Did it work? Why?


*** Exercise 43 - relationships and modeling database ***
    You are an entrepreneur who wants to sell ice cream online and now with your new programming skills you
    are going to develop online store to do just that!
        * You want a page where visitors will be able to see a list of ice creams (id, name, price, description)
        * Your customers will have to register to purchase ice cream, so you will also need to save information
          about them. (email, address)
        * Customers will be able to order products. A single order can consist of multiple products. And single
          customer can have multiple orders. For example, customer Janis currently has the following orders:
                order #1: 5x vanilla and 1x strawberry ice cream
                order #2: 2x chocolate and 3 "Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough" ice creams
           We also need to know the exact time customer made the order.

     1. Before writing code, you first need to model a database. Read the requirements and identify tables, columns
        and data types you will have to use/create for your database. (describe and send to teacher)
     2. Identify what relationships you will have to create between those tables. (describe and send to teacher)
     3. Now that you have a clear understanding of the database model/design, you can start implementing it in SQL!
            a. Write the necessary SQL statements to create tables and relationships between them.
            b. Insert some demo data in each of those tables
     4. Send your results to teacher.


*** Exercise 44 - model/create database ***
    1. Design and write SQL scripts creating the database "company". We will have to save info about:
       a. employees (first_name, last_name)
       b. departments (department)
       c. projects (description)
       d. Each employee can be assigned to none or a single departments
       e. Each employee can be assigned to none or multiple projects
    2. Insert some data:
       a. employees:
          Janis Logins
          Juris Krastins
          Ieva Liepina
          Jana Spidola
       b. departments:
          HR, IT, Marketing, Admins
       c. projects:
          Online Gaming, Insurance, Banking system, Communications
    8. Assign employees to departments:
        Janis to IT
        Juris to IT
        Ieva to HR
    9. Assign employees to projects:
        Jana to Online Gaming and Insurance
        Ieva to Banking System and Insurance
        Juris to Communications
    10. Write SQL queries for displaying the following data:
       a. departments that have no employees assigned to them
       b. only departments which have employees assigned to them
       c. first_name, last_name, department for all employees
       d. all employees (first_name, last_name) that are in project with X name (for example, "Insurance").
       e. first_name, last_name for all employees who are not assigned to department
       f. first_name, last_name, department only for employees which are assigned to a department
       g. All employees (first_name, last_name) in X department (for example, "IT") who name starts with "Ja"
       h. first_name, last_name, project for all employees / projects
       i. first_name, last_name, project for all employees / projects
       b. "description" only for projects which have employees assigned to them


*** Exercise 45 - JOINS ***
    Now lets return to our ice shop database and write some queries on it:
        1. write SQL statement which would return information for all customer orders:
            (first_name, last name, order_id, order_time, ice_cream_name, quantity, price)
        2. select the most ordered ice-creams and sort them by count in descending order
            (ice_cream, count)
        3. select customers with most orders (descending order)
            first_name, order_count
        4. select customers who have ordered most products in descending order (and only customers with more than 1
        product)
            first_name, product_count

    !Note: Please make sure you have needed data in your DB and properly test each SQL statement you write.
           You can always add additional data if you see something is missing.
