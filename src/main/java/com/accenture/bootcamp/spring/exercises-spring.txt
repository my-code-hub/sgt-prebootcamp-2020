    1) Define (using annotations) the following spring beans / dependencies:
          BeanA (has no dependencies)
          BeanB (has dependency BeanA)
          BeanC (has dependency BeanA and BeanB)
        Autowiring should be done via constructor.

        Tip: you will have to use @Component annotation.

    2) Define (using configuration class) the following beans:
        Owner (has no dependencies)
        Dog (has Owner property/dependency)
        Cat (has Owner property/dependency)
        House (has Owner, Dog and Cat dependency)

        Tip: You will have to use @Configuration and @Bean annotations for this.
