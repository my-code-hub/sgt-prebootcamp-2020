************** exercise 60 **************
    1) Setup your spring project
    2) Define (using annotations) the following spring beans / dependencies:
          BeanA (has no dependencies)
          BeanB (has dependency BeanA)
          BeanC (has dependency BeanA and BeanB)
        Autowiring should be done via constructor.
    3) Start your spring application and see if it actually works
        (make sure there are no exceptions)

        Tip: you will have to use @Component annotation.

    4) Define (using configuration class) the following beans:
        Owner (has no dependencies)
        Dog (has Owner property/dependency)
        Cat (has Owner property/dependency)
        House (has Owner, Dog and Cat dependency)
        Start your spring application and see if it actually works
                (make sure there are no exceptions)

        Tip: You will have to use @Configuration and @Bean annotations for this.

    5) Autowiring by interface practice:
        a) Create interface Shape
        b) Create class Triangle which implements interface Shape (configure it so it's a spring bean)
        c) Create class Square which implements interface Shape (configure it so it's a spring bean)
        d) Start the application. Did everything work? Did you have errors?
        e) Create bean Figures and try to autowire dependency (via constructor):
            private Shape shape1;
        f) Start the program, did it work? What's the problem? Can you google and find out
           why it doesn't work?
        g) How could you configure your application so the instance of Triangle would be autowired
           into Figures class, shape1 property?

        Tips: read about @Primary annotation

    Homework: read/understand about @Qualifier annotation and bean naming.
