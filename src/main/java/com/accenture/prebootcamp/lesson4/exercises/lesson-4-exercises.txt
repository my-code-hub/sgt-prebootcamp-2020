    Hints:
       Always format your code!
       Blank new lines are redundant.
       Every file should have a blank line at the end.
       Always choose proper, descriptive identifiers for your variables!

---------------- Exercises ---------------------
1) Find errors in this program and fix them:
    pub class Exercise 1 {

        public void main(String args) (
            system.oul.printn('Hello, World!'):
        )
    {


2) Write a Java program to declare two integer variables, one float variable, and one string variable and
  assign 10, 12.5, and "Java programming" to them respectively. Then display their values on the screen.


3) Which data type would you use to represent the following values?
    a) Child age

    Create a program which declares and initializes all these variables (any value you want) and outputs their
    values. When naming variables, try to think of a good and descriptive identifiers for those variables.


4)  a) Declare two float variables (x and y) and assign them values 2.5 and 5.4 (with separated declaration and
    initialization)
    b) Declare two float variables (a and b) and assign them values 3.5 and 6.4 (declaration and
      initialization in the same statement)


5) Find the errors in the following Java statements:
   a) int a, b, c
      a = 0
   b) System.out.println('ab');
   c) System.out.println( (3 + 2) – 1) );
   d) int d = 3.2;
   e) float e = 2.1;
      int f = e;
   f) int g = 10;
      float h;
      g = h;
   g) {
          int n;
      }
      n = 10;
      System.out.println(n);
   h) boolean a, b;
      a = false, b = true;
   i) int x;
      x = 1;
      r = x + 1;
   j) String s = 'This is a string';
   l) long number = 2000000000000000;
      System.out.println(number);
   m) char myChar = "b";
      System.out.println(myChar);
   n) final int myNumber = 20;
      myNumber++;
      System.out.println(myNumber);
   o) float myFloat = 0.5;
      System.out.println(myFloat);


 6) Write a Java program to print the sum of two numbers.
    Test Data:
    74 + 36
    Expected Output :
    Result is 110


7) Write a program which assigns the sum of two variables
   to other variable and outputs result:
  int x = 5;
  int y = 10;

  Expected output:
    Sum of 5 and 10 is 15


8) Write a Java program calculates and prints the result of the following operations.
      a. -5 + 8 * 6
      b. (55+9) % 9
      c. 20 + -3*5 / 8
      d. 5 + 15 / 3 * 2 - 8 % 3
  Expected Output :
        43
        1
        19
        13


9) Write a Java program to compute the specified expressions and print the output.
    Test Data:
        ((25.5 * 3.5 - 3.5 * 3.5) / (40.5 - 4.5))
    Expected Output
        2.138888888888889


10) Change the following program to use compound assignments:
    class ArithmeticDemo {

         public static void main (String[] args){

              int result = 1 + 2; // result is now 3
              System.out.println(result);

              result = result - 1; // result is now 2
              System.out.println(result);

              result = result * 2; // result is now 4
              System.out.println(result);

              result = result / 2; // result is now 2
              System.out.println(result);

              result = result + 8; // result is now 10
              result = result % 7; // result is now 3
              System.out.println(result);
         }
    }


11) In the following program, explain why the value "6" is printed twice in a row:
    class PrePostDemo {
        public static void main(String[] args){
            int i = 3;
            i++;
            System.out.println(i);    // "4"
            ++i;
            System.out.println(i);    // "5"
            System.out.println(++i);  // "6"
            System.out.println(i++);  // "6"
            System.out.println(i);    // "7"
        }
    }


12) Write a Java program to print "Hello" on screen and then print
  your name on a separate line.
   a) do it with two System.out.println statements
   b) do it with one System.out.println statement
  Expected Output :
    Hello
    John Doe


13) Write a Java program to display the following text. Go to the editor
   Sample Pattern :
       J    a   v     v  a
       J   a a   v   v  a a
    J  J  aaaaa   V V  aaaaa
     JJ  a     a   V  a     a


14) Write a Java program to print the area and perimeter of a rectangle.
    Declare variables width and height,
    assign them values 5.6 and 8.5. Then calculate are and perimeter and assign those values to new variables.
    Print out the variables which contain area and perimeter.
    Test Data:
        Width = 5.6 Height = 8.5

    Expected Output:
        Area is 5.6 * 8.5 = 47.60
        Perimeter is 2 * (5.6 + 8.5) = 28.20


15) Write a program which prints out the division reminder of two variables
    int a = 10;
    int b = 3;

    expected output:
        reminder of 10 / 3 is 1
